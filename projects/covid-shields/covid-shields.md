# Covid-19 Face Shields

When the pandemic hit, I worked with hobbyists and educators in Lake Placid, New York to 3D print, laser cut and deliver over 4500 face shields to essential workers and first responders in the Tri-Lakes region. As Head R&D Engineer, I adapted the US RC3 [design](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/) from Prusa Research to meet the needs of local healthcare professionals. As a 3D printing expert, I coordinated with hobbyists to maximize throughput and uptime.
