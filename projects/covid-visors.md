# Covid-19 Face Shields

When the pandemic hit, I worked with hobbyists, educators and others in Lake Placid, New York to deliver over 4500 face shields to health workers and first responders in the Tri-Lakes region.

## My role

As Head R&D Engineer, I adapted the [Prusa (RC3, US)](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/) design to meet the needs of local healthcare professionals.
