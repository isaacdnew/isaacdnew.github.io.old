# Ice Keys P3: Project Notes

*Notes prior to Jun 16 2021 are reconstructed from old memory.*

## Jun 16 2021: First Functional P3

Some of the cosmetic parts are missing or outdated, but everything that matters is assembled.

### Successes

1. The low notes are easy to tune and sound wonderful.
2. PLA has major perks: perfect seals and better overhangs.
3. The new choice of TPU for the tuning plugs makes perfect seals with great tunability.
4. The keys feel light and satisfying.
5. It looks amazing. The colors and lines work.

### Issues

1. Some valves don’t always close.
2. The upper postvalve’s pipes are too short.
3. The postvalves slide on their tabs to rest on the hand plates, lowering the keys.
4. The high notes are too loud compared to the low notes.
5. The keys’ tails were too big, so I trimmed them. Now the keys don’t line up.
6. A few keys squeak along the spring contact when pressed or released.
7. The tuning plug on the lowest note interferes with the mouth, preventing sound.

### Solutions

1. Move the spring contact point farther from the fulcrum and closer to the pincher.
2. Measure high pitches vs lengths at pressures needed for lower notes; update the model.
3. Revert postvalve tab/slot position (the postvalve should slide down onto the manifold).
4. Taper the manifold’s inside. Lots of CAD work.
5. After reprinting the manifold and postvalves, test again to determine proper height.
6. Rough up or lubricate the spring contacts.
7. Print a short tuning plug for the lowest note.

### Questions

1. Since I’ll be reprinting the keys and hand plates, should I use clear PLA for them?
2. Should I use a larger nozzle for the hand plates to speed them up?
3. Are the guides for the silicone tube on the manifold's pincher necessary?
4. Should I print the manifolds at 45 degrees instead of 30, to improve the overhang finish?

### Moving forward

The only parts that don’t need reprinting are the tuning plugs, which should fit the next postvalves just fine.
