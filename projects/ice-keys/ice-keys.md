# Ice Keys

An acoustic keyboard that sounds like pan pipes.

The first prototype, with 25 keys. A 3-tone color palette and exposed mechanisms give it a steampunk feel.

Main Issues:

1. **Pipe sealing.** The pipes don’t seal well enough with the blocks that hold them, so the sound is at best a whisper.
2. **Heavy key action.** The keys are hard to press.
3. **Bad ergonomics.** It’s hard to hold (since it has no handle) and hard to play (since it has stiff, narrow keys).
4. **Incorrect pipe lengths.** The model I used to determine the lengths is based on too many idealizations.
5. **Looks.** The blue color is too pale and the off-white keys look dirty.
